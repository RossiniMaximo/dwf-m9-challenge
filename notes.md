It is okay if we only do test in functions/classes that do not have a directly connection
to the database. Because those are called integration tests and are more complex, I could try
but I'm not forced to.

For the products I have to use the algolia + airtable combination that we used in the past.

I have to send emails.

I have to test some function and scheme some endpoints.

I left working on : ME endpoint , database is not returning any data
